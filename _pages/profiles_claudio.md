I'm a physicist specialized in complex systems, which Iâ€™ve mostly applied to neuroscience. I'm fascinated by the mechanisms that transform interactions among physical entities into something extraordinary like thought. 

My background as a physicist gives me a broad foundation across many fields, allowing me to explore beyond my main research area, which is something I deeply enjoy.
