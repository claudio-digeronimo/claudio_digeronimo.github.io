I’m a physicist with a focus on complex systems which is the study of how simple interacting elements give rise to emergent behavior. Over the past year, I’ve applied these methods to neuroscience, exploring how physical interactions within biological systems can lead to complex behaviors. 



I enjoy both writing code, as in the projects I present here, and working on more hands-on tasks. What motivates me most is seeing tangible, observable results from my work, regardless of the field. That’s why I enjoy exploring different fields, where variety keeps my work creative, and interesting.
