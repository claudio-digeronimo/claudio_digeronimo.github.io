  <p>
    Our group was founded in the Florence area, in small towns where quiet evenings sparked the wish to build something together.
    What began as a mix of curiosity, boredom, and a shared drive to create has turned into a space for ideas, experiments, and teamwork.
  </p>

  <p>
    We started with a project on waste management, believing it can bring real value to the community, but we’re always open to new directions.
