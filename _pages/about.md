    <p>
	Weâ€™re developing software tools for analyzing images acquired with drones to improve waste management and 	environmental 	monitoring.  
	Born from a friendship and a shared curiosity for technology, our group began with a project on waste management, 	aiming to create value for the community while exploring new ways to connect technology with environmental care.
