Driven by a lifelong passion for engines, I pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in road vehicles, which naturally led me to explore the dynamics of mechanical systems in greater depth.

I currently work as a Process Engineer and Industrialization Specialist at a major Italian electronics company with a global presence, specializing in the development of hardware and software for Artificial Intelligence.

Motivated by a strong sense of curiosity, I constantly seek to understand how things around me work. Asking questions comes naturally to me, finding answers is my true passion.
