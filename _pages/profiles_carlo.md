Mechanical engineer by training, data analyst by passion.

I work in the IT department of a multinational company in the manufacturing sector, but my curiosity drives me beyond working hours to explore and understand how technology can make life a bit simpler and more interesting.

I love challenges, learning new things, and finding creative ways to use data and innovation to make a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives.
